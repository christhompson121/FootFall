# FootFall

For a detailed writeup of this Hackathon project please see the [DevPost submission](https://devpost.com/software/footfall). This project was created during HackSheffield 1.0 in 2016.

# Who made it?

[Chris Thompson](https://github.com/christhompson121), [Tzen Szen Toh](https://github.com/szen95) and myself.

# What is it?

FootFall is a platform that allows users to visualise the hottest events happening around them. They can search for different locations around the world and nearby Facebook events will be displayed on a heatmap.

This project is unique because Facebook doesn't make it easy to get events by location. We found a way around this and produced this application!

We believe that our target audience includes taxi companies, law enforcement, party goers and generally anyone who wants to find events in a particular location or see where lots of people may be due to events.

# Some notes

- This project uses another open source project called ['Facebook events by location'](https://github.com/tobilg/facebook-events-by-location). A very handy express.js Node API implementation of the workaround we discovered.

- The code is likely to be a bit messy and your mileage may vary getting it to work.

- For demo purposes at the Hackathon, we set the access control allow origin to '*'. If you use this project in production, you may want to change this!

*P.S. We won some pretty cool prizes too :D*
